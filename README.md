# MMCDR

**Disentangling Shared and Specific Representations for Multimodal Cross-Domain Recommendation via Cosine-Based Regularization**  
*Submitted to IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems (IEICE Trans. Inf. & Sys.)*

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of **MMCDR**, a novel framework for multimodal cross-domain recommendation. The proposed method disentangles shared and domain-specific representations using cosine-based regularization, enabling more effective knowledge transfer across domains and modalities.

## Paper Status

The paper is currently **under review** at *IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems*.

**Note:**  
As the manuscript is under peer review, the repository is currently in a limited-release state. Some details, including datasets, trained models, and complete documentation, will be provided after the review process concludes.
